# Greetings ðŸ‘‹

I work on Angular, Node and Rust projects in my free time.

Currently, I'm focusing on [DoubleNote](https://github.com/Bernd-L/DoubleNote), my flagship project. It's a note-taking application based on Angular, which aims to provide an offline-first, versioned, collaborative editing experience for its users.

Previously, [ExDateMan](https://github.com/Bernd-L/ExDateMan) (which is short for _Expiration Date Manager_) was my primary fucus. It's a simple application for managing shared food inventories so nothing expires.

In the future, I want to look into Rust development, and gain some experience there. So far, I worked on Angular frontend applications, Node.js backend servers and old Java programs.

I believe in free, open source software and the benefits this brings with it, which is why most of my projects are licensed under the [AGPL license](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.en.html).

Feel free to check out my code and send issues and pull requests my way ðŸ¤—
