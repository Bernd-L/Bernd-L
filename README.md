# Greetings ðŸ‘‹

I work on Rust, Angular and Node projects in my free time:

- [DoubleNote](https://github.com/Bernd-L/DoubleNote) is a note-taking application made with Angular, which aims to provide an offline-first, versioned, collaborative editing experience for its users
- [od-get](https://github.com/Bernd-L/od-get) is a command-line application for crawling and downloading open directories implemented in Rust
- [cr-tools](https://github.com/Bernd-L/cr-tools) provides its users a very simple way to figure out which cards to request first when playing Clash Royale; implemented in Rust targeting WebAssembly
- [ExDateMan](https://github.com/Bernd-L/ExDateMan) (which is short for _Expiration Date Manager_) is a simple application for managing shared food inventories to prevent food from expiring
- [libocc-ts](https://github.com/Bernd-L/libocc-ts) and [libocc-rs](https://github.com/Bernd-L/libocc-rs) are a library for event-sourced data management for occasionally connected computing, written in Rust and TypeScript, respectively

I believe in free, open source software and the benefits this brings with it, which is why most of my projects are licensed under the [AGPL license](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.en.html).

Feel free to check out my code and send issues and pull requests my way ðŸ¤—
